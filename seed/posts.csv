1,False,7,6,"Prints have excessive stringing regardless of retraction settings.","The bowden tube fitting in the extruder had partially failed, allowing the bowden tube to move back and forth instead of the filament, preventing true retraction."
1,False,7,8,"Specific print showed severe layer shift at 80% layer height.","Insufficient cooling caused an overhang to curl up, which blocked the nozzle during movement. The motor could not push past the curled up overhang, causing it to skip steps until the travel move ended. An increase in fan speed prevented the overhang from curling up and blocking the nozzle."
1,False,3,16,"Long thin and tall print detached from bed at 65% completion.","Orienting the long side of the part parallel to the bed axis prevented the part from falling over."
1,False,7,3,"Corners of part on the bed warped and curled up.","ABS can be printed successfully on an unenclosed printer by drastically reducing print speed, and increasing extrusion temperature above recommended settings. 270C at 20 mm/s solved the warping for this particular print."
1,False,7,8,"Prints contain many thick strings across travel moves.","Nylon filaments rapidly absorb moisture. The filament was initially dried according to Polymaker specs and printed from a drybox which consistently indicated 10% humidity or below. However, this was insufficient, and a second run in the dehydrator for longer than Polymaker's recommendation solved the stringing."
1,False,4,6,"The top surface of the part showed gaps between extrusion lines.","The extruder was out of calibration, and insufficient material was being extruded. Calibration the extruder and correcting esteps in the printer fixed this problem."
